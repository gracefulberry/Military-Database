# Getting started 

#### Prerequisites
- **MySQL** or **MariaDB** must be installed for utilization of the Database Dump.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
- Using prettytable library: 
```pip3 install PTable```

**Note:** MariaDB is similar to MySQL but is also faster to use and easier to install.
 
- **Python3** is required for running the database CLI

:warning: **You must use Python 3**: Not using python3 might result in errors.

### Initiating the Database
Once the above prerequisites are met in your system, follow these steps:

- Open `mysql` on local server.
- Create a user and grant it priviledges: 
	```sql
    CREATE USER '<user>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<user>'@'localhost';
	```
- Dump the  database into `ash` from `core/SQL` using:
	```
	mysql -u <user> -p 
	source dumpfile.sql
	```
- Relocate yourself to `core/Python` and run the following:
    ```bash
    python3 ash_world.py 
    ```
- Enter the database using "Host", "User" and "Password" with the details of the user (**with all permissions**).
                                       
:warning: **Use user with all permisions**: Not using user without all permission may cause issues during runtime.
